        <h1>Soil Health Information</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction to Soil Health</h2>
        <p>
            Soil health refers to the condition of soil in terms of physical, chemical, and biological processes. 
            This information is aimed at helping farmers and land managers understand and maintain the health of their soil.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Type of Soil is Suitable for Different Crops?</h2>
        <p>
            Soil types can vary significantly based on factors such as the underlying geology, climate, and agricultural history.
            However, there are some general guidelines for choosing suitable soils for different crops:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Crops with deep roots, such as tomatoes and strawberries, typically require a deep, well-drained soil.
                These soils have a high organic matter content and a well-developed root zone.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shallow-rooted crops, such as corn and soybeans, generally thrive in soils with a medium texture and adequate water holding capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Root crops, such as carrots and potatoes, benefit from a loose, sandy soil with good aeration.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Irrigation Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            The proper application of water is essential for maintaining soil health and crop productivity.
            There are several irrigation techniques that can be used, depending on the soil type, climate, and crop requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sprinkler or drip irrigation: This method is suitable for sandy soils with a low water holding capacity.</li>
            <li>Flood irrigation: This technique involves inundating the soil with water, allowing the roots to access water deep in the soil.</li>
            <li>Ditch irrigation: In this method, water is channeled to the field through a ditch or canal, which allows for efficient distribution and deep soil moisture penetration.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Natural Fertilizer Uses</h2>
        <p>
            Natural fertilizers play a crucial role in maintaining soil health and improving crop productivity.
            They are typically used to improve soil structure, enhance nutrient availability, and increase organic matter content.
            Some common natural fertilizers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crop residues: These can be incorporated into the soil to improve soil structure and organic matter content.</li>
            <li>Green manures: These are cover crops grown for a short period before being incorporated into the soil to improve nutrient availability and soil health.</li>
            <li>Compost and manure: These are the result of decomposing organic matter and can be used to enhance soil fertility and structure.</li>
        </ul>
